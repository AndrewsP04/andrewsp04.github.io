        <p>
            I am a senior at UNC Charlotte studying Computer Science with a focus in Human-Computer Interaction. 
            Designing and creating user interfaces and prototypes just give me so much excitement. I love listening 
            to music and I don’t know if I can call myself an audiophile but I have spent significant dollars 
            on music streaming services and listening devices to get the best sound.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Personal Background:</strong> I was born in India and I’m currently 22 years old. I love cars and tech devices. Not just computers but TVs, audio devices, game consoles, smartphones, etc.</li>
            <li><strong>Professional Background:</strong> I have worked 30 days in the Audi service department, before realizing that it’s not for me. Then I switched to Geek Squad as Advanced Repair Agent and also a Certified Apple Repair Agent. I worked for a year repairing PCs, Macs, iPhones, and also helping out the client facing agents when necessary to help customers in check-in their devices for repairs/shipping.</li>
            <li><strong>Academic Background:</strong> I’m currently a Senior at UNC Charlotte studying Computer Science with a focus in Human-Computer Interaction. Before that I attended high school in Littleton, Massachusetts and Apex, North Carolina. I started out at Wake Tech and got my Associates in Science degree. Later I transferred to UNC Greensboro and realized that that school was not for me and transferred once more to UNC Charlotte.</li>
            <li><strong>Background in this Subject:</strong> I have twice taken this course with varying degrees of success and ultimately ended up dropping on both occasions. But now I am locked in!</li>
            <li><strong>Primary Work Computer:</strong> The laptop I use for university is a Lenovo Yoga 9i running Windows 11 Pro with 12th Gen Intel Core i7 and 16GB of RAM. Bogs down heavily under pressure because RAM is not enough even though I got the highest config at the time of purchase. Unfortunately the RAM is soldered to the board however I came this far with this laptop, so I decided to go past the finish line with this setup and save money.</li>
            <li><strong>Backup Work Computer & Location Plan:</strong> No planned backup option for now, but if need be then library is my option.</li>
            <li><strong>Courses I'm Taking & Why:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>ITIS3135 - Front-End Web App Development: Required class.</li>
                    <li>ITSC 2600 - CS Program, Identity, Career: Required class.</li>
                    <li>ITSC 3688 - Comp & Their Impact on Society: Required class.</li>
                </ul>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>I’d also like to share:</strong> NinerLink will be my kryptonite.</p>
