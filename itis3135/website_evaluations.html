        <h2>Website Evaluations</h2>

        <section>
            <h3><a href="https://www.volvocars.com" target="_blank">Volvo Cars</a></h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> Strong use of white space against high-resolution imagery and bold typography makes the content easy to read.</li>
                <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> Consistent use of the Volvo Broad font and minimalist button styles creates a unified brand experience.</li>
                <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Elements are strictly aligned to a grid, providing a clean, organized, and professional layout.</li>
                <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Related information (like car specs and pricing) is grouped tightly, reducing cognitive load for the user.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3><a href="https://www.amazon.com" target="_blank">Amazon</a></h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> The page is often cluttered with too many competing colors, banners, and buttons, making it hard to find a focal point.</li>
                <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> While the logo is consistent, the vast variety of card styles and ad formats feels disjointed and repetitive in a chaotic way.</li>
                <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Information is packed into every corner, leading to a "wall of text" feel where alignment is often sacrificed for sheer volume.</li>
                <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Sponsored items are often mixed closely with organic results, confusing the relationship between different types of content.</li>
            </ul>
